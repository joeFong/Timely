                <h1>Features</h1>
                <p>This project was designed with the requirements that our instructor and client, Bruce Link, has set for us. The webapp is a timesheet which employees can track the amount of hours worked. This makes it convenient for supervisors and managers to track their pay, their progress, and their efficiency. The web app features additional features including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A separation of roles between employees</li>
					<li>The ability for supervisors and managers to assign roles and projects to employees</li>
					<li>An automated monthly and weekly report for the project manager</li>
					<li>The approval of said timesheet by a timesheet approver</li>
					<li>Admin control</li>
				</ul>
